# 🐍 SnakeMonGame

A fun console-based game built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Inspired by the classic Snake game, SnakeMonGame introduces new twists and a bonus system to enhance gameplay and learning.

## 🎮 Game Overview

SnakeMonGame combines the mechanics of traditional Snake with additional features like:

- Dynamic movement and collision detection
- Point collection system
- Increasing difficulty over time
- **Bonus mode** for special challenges

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** — Main programming language
- **OOP Concepts** — Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
- **Standard Template Library (STL)** — For data handling where needed
- **Console I/O** — ASCII-based rendering
